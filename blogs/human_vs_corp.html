                    <h1 class="major" style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Corporate Anatomy 101: Your Company is Basically a Giant Human! 🏢💪</h1>
                    <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #aaa;">Aug 17, 2025</span>
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <p>Ever wondered why your office feels like a living, breathing creature? That's because it literally IS! Grab your stethoscope and let's dissect the corporate body - warning: no actual surgery required, but you might never look at your colleagues the same way again!</p>

                    <h2>The Command Center (AKA "The Thinking Parts")</h2>
                    
                    <h3>🧠 Brain = The C-Suite (The Big Thinkers)</h3>
                    <p>Meet your corporate brain! These are the folks who sit in corner offices making "strategic decisions" while the rest of us wonder if they've actually lost their minds. Just like your brain, they consume 20% of the company's energy budget but somehow convince everyone they're worth it.</p>

                    <h3>⚡ Nervous System = IT & Communications (The Office Gossip Network)</h3>
                    <p>Your company's neural pathways are those IT cables snaking through the walls and that Slack channel that mysteriously knows everything before the official announcement. When this system crashes, watch your entire corporate body have a spectacular meltdown!</p>

                    <h2>The Life Force Department</h2>

                    <h3>❤️ Heart = Company Culture (The Soul of the Beast)</h3>
                    <p>The heart pumps passion, values, and the occasional motivational poster throughout the organization. When it's healthy, everyone's singing Kumbaya. When it's not? Well, let's just say even the office plants start looking for new jobs.</p>

                    <h3>🫁 Lungs = R&D Team (The Oxygen Tank Squad)</h3>
                    <p>These beautiful creatures breathe life into stagnant companies with fresh ideas! They inhale boring market trends and exhale game-changing innovations. Pro tip: If your R&D team isn't getting enough oxygen (budget), your company might literally suffocate in mediocrity.</p>

                    <h3>🩸 Circulatory System = Operations & Supply Chain (The Amazon Prime of Body Parts)</h3>
                    <p>The unsung heroes ensuring everything gets where it needs to go, when it needs to be there. They're basically the FedEx drivers of your corporate body - and just as essential for keeping everything alive!</p>

                    <h2>The Regulatory Committee (The Fun Police)</h2>

                    <h3>💉 Hormones = HR Department (The Mood Ring Masters)</h3>
                    <p>HR regulates everything from office temperature disputes to "Dave from Accounting's inappropriate use of the Reply All button." They're the body's emotional thermostat - keeping everyone from either falling asleep or starting workplace wars.</p>

                    <h3>🛡️ Immune System = Security, Legal & Compliance (The Corporate Bouncers)</h3>
                    <p>These are your organization's white blood cells, constantly scanning for threats like hackers, lawsuits, and employees who think "casual Friday" means pajama pants. They're not fun at parties, but they'll save your corporate life!</p>

                    <h3>🫘 Kidneys = Quality Assurance (The Corporate Detox Team)</h3>
                    <p>QA teams filter out the toxic sludge before it reaches customers. They're basically your company's built-in BS detector - and trust us, they've seen some stuff that would make your grandmother blush.</p>

                    <h2>The Architecture Department</h2>

                    <h3>🦴 Skeleton = Organizational Chart (The Corporate Jungle Gym)</h3>
                    <p>Those mind-numbing org charts aren't just pretty diagrams - they're your company's backbone! Without them, your organization would be a shapeless blob of confused employees wandering around asking "Who's my boss again?"</p>

                    <h3>💪 Muscles = The Workforce (The Real MVPs)</h3>
                    <p>The beautiful humans who actually DO the work while everyone else talks about doing the work. They're the corporate biceps, and when they flex, stuff actually happens!</p>

                    <h2>The Customer Relations Team</h2>

                    <h3>👤 Skin = Marketing & Brand Teams (The Pretty Face Operation)</h3>
                    <p>Your company's skin is what everyone sees first - the logo, the website, that awkward commercial that somehow got approved. When it's glowing, everyone wants to touch it (metaphorically, please). When it breaks out in corporate acne? Yikes.</p>

                    <h3>👀👂 Eyes & Ears = Market Research (The Corporate Spies)</h3>
                    <p>These sneaky intelligence gatherers are always watching, always listening. They know what your competitors had for lunch and somehow turn that into actionable business insights. Creepy? Yes. Essential? Absolutely.</p>

                    <h3>👄 Mouth = Sales Team (The Smooth Talkers)</h3>
                    <p>The charmers who convince people to give you money in exchange for your stuff. They're literally the reason your corporate body doesn't starve. Feed them coffee and commission checks, and they'll keep your business well-nourished!</p>

                    <h2>The Money Department</h2>

                    <h3>🍎 Digestive System = Finance & Accounting (The Number Crunchers)</h3>
                    <p>These magical beings take raw revenue and transform it into spreadsheets, budgets, and those quarterly reports that make everyone nervous. They're basically your company's food processors - turning business "meals" into corporate nutrition.</p>

                    <h3>🫄 Liver = Strategic Planning (The Hangover Cure Squad)</h3>
                    <p>When your company makes questionable decisions (looking at you, "New Coke"), strategic planning swoops in to detoxify the situation and keep the business healthy. They're the designated driver of the corporate world!</p>

                    <h2>The Grand Finale: Why This Matters (Besides Being Hilariously Accurate)</h2>

                    <h3>🤯 Mind-Blowing Insights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When your "corporate liver" (strategy team) is overworked, your whole company gets sluggish and makes terrible decisions</li>
                        <li>If your "HR hormones" are out of whack, expect mood swings that would make a teenager jealous</li>
                        <li>A broken "IT nervous system" literally paralyzes your entire corporate body faster than you can say "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>🚨 Warning Signs Your Corporate Body Needs a Doctor:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your brain (leadership) keeps forgetting what your mouth (sales) promised</li>
                        <li>Your immune system (compliance) is attacking your own healthy cells (innovative employees)</li>
                        <li>Your digestive system (finance) can't process the junk food (bad investments) you keep feeding it</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>💊 The Prescription for Corporate Health:</h3>
                    <p>Keep all your body parts talking to each other, feed them properly (budget allocation, anyone?), and for the love of all that's holy, don't let any single organ think it's more important than the others. Yes, we're looking at you, Marketing!</p>

                    <p>Remember: A healthy corporate body is a happy corporate body. And a happy corporate body doesn't make employees fantasize about becoming professional dog walkers instead! 🐕‍🦺</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Now excuse me while I go check if my company's appendix (that random department nobody understands) needs removing...</p>
