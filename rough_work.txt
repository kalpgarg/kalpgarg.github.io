To be added in about section. 

I enjoy turning research ideas into practical applications and sharing my implementation experiences through articles. I value clean, readable, and self-contained codeâ€”Python is my language of choice.

I'm also enthusiastic about open-source software and have contributed to several high-impact projects, including Keras, KerasCV, ðŸ¤— Transformers, TensorFlow Hub, Keras Examples, TensorFlow Addons, and Neural Structured Learning.
